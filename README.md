# Hi, I'm Ilias ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

As a hardworking and dedicated individual with a passion for computer science, I have spent over 5000 hours honing my skills in Flutter/Dart, and an additional 3000 hours studying the field. Despite facing the challenges of a brain tumor, I have worked on projects with prestigious organizations such as the **UN** and the **Panteio University of Greece**, demonstrating my ability to work effectively both independently and as part of a team.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have a diverse range of personal interests including cooking, fitness, electric guitar, drawing, Italian, privacy, and security. These interests have helped me develop a well-rounded and creative approach to problem-solving, which I believe will be an asset to any employer.

I am excited to bring my skills, experience, and dedication to a dynamic organization that values teamwork, innovation, and a commitment to excellence.

## My Skills

### Programming Languages

#### Proficient at:

- **Dart/Flutter**
	- Deep understanding of the Dart runtime
	- Familiar with all Dart syntax
	- Already using and loving Dart 3.0 (pattern-matching, class modifiers, destructuring, records)
	- Understanding of the internals of the Flutter framework
	- Can include third-party platform specific code
	- Understanding of Streams and Futures
	- Can work with isolates
	- Have experimented with FFI
	- Understanding of plugins and packages with platform specific implementations
	- Have developed personal libraries (more than 20k lines of original code and 5k lines of modified third-party code)
	- Only a few known-unknowns for now:
		- New ways of including platform specific code like JNI
		- FFI with objective-c and swift
		- Dart exclusively used as a backend language (although, I don't think it is fitted for that use-case)
		- Writing custom annotations and utilizing build-runner
		- Have not yet experimented with generators
		- Have not used callable classes
		- Never came across the need to use `Expando`, so I cannot really say that I understand what it does

#### Good understanding and working experience:

- **JavaScript**
	- Can write and debug front-end JavaScript applications
	- Have worked with React and JSX
	- Have some entry level experience with Node
- **HTML5**
	- Can effectively use semantic tags
	- Care about accessibility
- **CSS3**
	- Have debugged many CSS3 stylesheets
	- Can create simple animations with keyframes

#### Familiarity:

- **C**
	- Can read and navigate C code
	- Understand how pointers and heap memory works
	- Mindful about C pitfalls and undefined behavior that can lead to crashes and serious security bugs
- **Java**
	- Can read and navigate Java code
	- Can write simple Java applications at an academic level
	- Aware of the dangers of null pointer exceptions
- **Python**
	- Can navigate python code
- **Rust**
	- Have written some Rust code in an effort to integrate Dart to a Rust tool
	- Some understanding of the difficulties of borrowing and lifetimes

#### Interedted in:

- **Zig**, amazing syntax, it really feels like C with superpowers (aka known undefined behavior)
- **Go**, a lot of code is being written in Go so it might be prove useful
- **Pony**, which has a very interesting approach in language design utilizing capabilities, and is conceptually very intriguing

### Other skills

- **English**: Excellent writing/listening and very good speaking abilities
- **Linux**: Power user of Debian based distributions, currently experimenting with PopOS
- **Git*: Understand and conceptualize different Git flows and use of conventional commits and semver
- **UI/UX Design**: Studied UI design and UX to be able to communicate with other departments, bridging the gap with development
- **Privacy and Security**: Deeply care about privacy and providing solutions that respect clients and their clients
- **Digital Marketing**: Experimented with digital marketing, promoting a business on their social media accounts
- **Academic Knowledge**: Studied operating systems, software development lifecycle, artificial intelligence, data structures and algorithms, system security, and networking at an academic entry level.
- **Excellent research abilities**: University's CS program fell short of my expectations by a lot, so I turned to self-studying instead. In that period I had to be able to find quality information in a huge pool of content, so I spent a huge amount of time perfecting my research skills.

## Professional Work

I have developed various closed source work for a diverse clientele earlier in my career. Some of my works include:

- [mepielan.gr](https://mepielan.gr), website for the __Mediterranean Programme for International Environmental Law And Negotiation__, then under the juristictionof the Panteio University of Greece, and currently under the UN. The organization has been delighted not only by my work, but also the extensive support and help that I've offered, and they have currently trusted with a second project, which is still under development.
- [apofraxeis-nk.gr](https://apofraxeis-nk.gr/), a website design and development for a plumbing freelancer
- [tambook.gr](https://tambook.gr/), my first ever project, a simple blogging website for a friend. Volunteer work.

## My Projects

- [utilities](https://github.com/helpisdev/utilities.git), personal Dart/Flutter library with hundreds of features, including but not limited to routing, extensions, localization, theming, widgets, and more.
- [helpis_cli](https://github.com/helpisdev/helpis_cli.git), personal CLI utility with a range of commands for generating project templates, theming utilities to be used with `FlexColorScheme`, creating storage caches, and more.
- [adaptive_scaffold](https://github.com/helpisdev/adaptive_scaffold.git), forked from the original [flutter_adaptive_scaffold](https://github.com/flutter/packages/tree/main/packages/flutter_adaptive_scaffold), and modified significantly, adding a ton of configuration options, modularizing the code, adding extra features like `GTKHeaderBar`, and more.
- [gtk_window](https://github.com/helpisdev/gtk_window.git), forked from [this package](https://github.com/YoussefLasheen/gtk_window), I have added loads of features like hotkeys, context menus, significantly improved UI, and more.
- [mason_templates](https://github.com/helpisdev/mason_templates), which contains the backbone template of `helpis create` command from `helpis_cli`
- Experiment for adding Dart support to the [tauri project](https://github.com/tauri-apps), by translating their `typescript` API to Dart in [this pull request](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/6636), and by implementing a generator for Dart bindings in Rust in [this pull request](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-bindgen/pull/99). Unfortunately, the pull requests didn't get merged due to lack of resources, but I would be happy to re-work them.
- [utilities_example](https://github.com/helpisdev/utilities_example), which is a full-blown demo application showcasing `utilities`, and includes theming, localization, routing, state management, caching, a radio player, and more.

## Previous projects for educational purposes

> Note: Some of the following depended on school resources that me be offline now

### C++

- [chess](https://github.com/helpisdev/chess.git), a fully functional chess game with UI implemented using an educational graphics library. Tested on linux and debugged with GDB and memory sanitizer. It probably still has many memory leaks, but it is fully functional even for advanced chess rules!
- [calculator](https://github.com/helpisdev/calculator.git), a CLI calculator designed with formal languages and grammars in mind
- [shell](https://github.com/helpisdev/shell.git), a very simple shell in an a effort to learn about processes in linux

### Java

- [generalized-8-queen-problem](https://github.com/helpisdev/generalized-8-queen-problem.git), CLI Java application experimenting with genetic AI algorithms
- [missionaries-cannibals-problem-with-a-star](https://github.com/helpisdev/missionaries-cannibals-problem-with-a-star.git), CLI Java application solved with Djikstra's A* algorithm

### Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

- [educational-platform](https://github.com/helpisdev/educational-platform.git), a mock educational platform with courses, registration, and local storage, focusing on the front-end aspect of things and accessibility (fully navigatable with keyboard)
- [educational-platform-v2](https://github.com/helpisdev/educational-platform-v2.git), same as above, with less emphasis on the front-end and implementation of a node/express server, handlebars in the UI, fetching info from an API (sadly the API provided by the school has been since shutted down), registration, and MongoDB
